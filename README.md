> Transform a JSON in a SiddhiQL valid sentence.


## What this project aims to improve 

This project is an attemp to deal with the difficult of business guys to elaborate queries and filters for use with events an them produce de desirable alerts in WSO2 CEP Complex Event Processor, at Produban Brazil.

As [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing) states, Complex event processing, or CEP, is event processing that combines data from multiple sources to infer events or patterns that suggest more complicated
circumstances. CEP can executes a set of rules which, as said, can infer events, patterns and sequences.

The idea is to provide for the users a grafical user interface made with love in Angular that allow users to compose rules, filter, windows and combine with Threshold  and any kind of value to compose sofisticated queries for generate alerts in CEP execution plans  WITHOUT dive into Siddhi Query Language, a SQL-like language that lets you work with data stream, se language syntax or details. Remember, the target are the business guys and not the tech geeks only.

The rules are written on JSON and accessed and modified via the REST API by this application. Them the valid query is deployed in the CEP execution plan to be available to fire alerts accordingly.  

Some features available

* Aggregate functions like averages, sums, max, min, stddev and counts.
* Filters and Query Projection using mathematical and logical expressions.
* Default value to an attribute.

Some features available

* Implement window for imput streams.
* Implement partitions .

In fact, a fancy query bellow:.
```sql
from InputStreamName [ metric == “system.dsk.utilization” and value >= 80 and tsName == “I_BIG_DATA_MONITORING” and (fileSystem == “/pdr/bdm” or
                                         fileSystem == “/pdrbdm/tool/level”)]
select
        “BIG_DATA_MONITORING”, metric, “’ do FileSystem: ‘”, fileSystem, “’ above threshold: 80%”, “. Value: “, value, “%.” ) as message,
        “open” as eventstatus,
        “critical” as severity,
        80.0 as threshold,
        csId as id,
        fileSystem as item,
        value as value,
        hostname as hostname,
        businessService as businessService,
        technicalService as technicalService,
        serviceComponent as serviceComponent,
        environment as environment,
        lsFunction as lsFunction,
        hyperName as hyperName,
        csSite as csSite,
        platform as platform,
        rule as rule,
        status as status,
        timestamp as timestamp,
        tool as tool

insert into InputStreamName;
```
 Is generated by the followed JSON data:

```json
{
  "cepRuleId": "xb1825091352016111717889",
  "created_by_user": "b18er45",
  "edited_by_user": "b18er45: (13/5/2016)-(11:17:17)",
  "tool": "openbus_br_zabbix_v2",
  "rule_filters": [
    {
      "field": "platform",
      "operator": "==",
      "value": "Wintel",
      "condition": "AND"
    },
    {
      "field": "metric",
      "operator": "==",
      "value": "system.dsk.utilization",
      "condition": "AND"
    },
    {
      "field": "hostname",
      "operator": "==",
      "value": "SBRSP3",
      "condition": "AND"
    },
    {
      "field": "fileSystem",
      "operator": "==",
      "value": "E:",
      "condition": "AND"
    },
    {
      "field": "value",
      "operator": ">=",
      "value": "95",
      "condition": "AND"
    },
    {
      "field": "value",
      "operator": "<",
      "value": "99",
      "condition": "END"
    }
  ]
}
```


##  Requirements for setup and to run

If you don't have the runtime at least for Oracle Java 8, you'll need to install it.

Will be necessary to be Gradle 2.x installed and configured too in your system to allow build this project.
 
Only this will be necessary.

## Building

Windows, OS X & Linux:

Grab the jar in some place that you want or build your self, first clone this repo. 

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Bera/Json2SiddhiCEP.git
```
After access de directory Json2SiddhiCEP and perform the gradle task bellow

```java
gradle build
```

For tests please execute

```sh
gradle test
```


## Usage 

After build you can run the app with executing the fat jar generated
```java
java -jar build/libs/rule-service-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## API

The REST API lets you add, remove, list and synchronize queries on the fly.

Endpoints

The following endpoints should be available demonstrating different features, look at the  Dashboard at http://localhost:8080/.

Base endpoints: 

-     GET /api/rules => get all rules (getAll)
-     GET /api/rules/:id => get the rule with the corresponding id (getOne)
-     POST /api/rule => add a new rule (addOne)
-     PUT /api/rule/:id => update a rule (updateOne)
-     DELETE /api/rule/id => delete a rule (deleteOne)

The complete documentation is auto generated by spring rest docs and ascii docs /src/main/resources/html5/index.html.

```java
gradle asciidoc
```
And the documentation is generated in the file index.html under resources folder and under html5 in the fat jar.

## Release History
